We have been exploring the SSI space for quite some time. To know more about who we are what we are doing, I encourage you to 

Disclaimer

> This is going to be a long blog since a lot of concept needs to be explained. But I will try to do full justice to your time by explaining Self Sovereign Identity with a visual demonstration using a simple use case on Hypersign Studio.

## Basic of SSI

> Self-sovereign identity intent to give control of user data back to the user by leveraging the use of technologies like Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Blockchain. 

> In SSI ecosystem, each party (issuer, holder, verifier) can create their own identifier, called Decentralised Identifier (DID), by publishing their public key on the public blockchain network and can verify each other independently. 

To understand the concept of SSI in-detail, I encourage you to read [this](https://hypermineresearch.netlify.app/posts/ssi-detail/) blog before proceeding. To understand why Blockchain plays a major role in SSI infrastructure, please read [this](https://hypermineresearch.netlify.app/posts/need-of-blockchain-ssi/) blog. 

## Hypersign

Now that we have some understanding of SSI, we need to think of a way to implement it. Many people are already taking that step to bring SSI to end-user. In-fact there is a dedicate community, [W3C Credential community](https://www.w3.org/community/credentials/), working on this.

> Hypersign is an Identity layer built on the [æternity blockchain](https://aeternity.com/) network and is designed to provide a self-sovereign identity for earth’s seven billion humans and their devices.

Hypersign implements [SSI specification](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/) and has released its version - `v1.0` in the form of POC. In this version, blockchain is not used but most of the concepts of SSI can be understood very well. The complete plan for the future versions can be found in [this](https://forum.aeternity.com/t/hypersign-poc-demo-for-aeternity-community-stage-1/7858) thread.

### Components

* [Hypresign Identity Explorer](https://ssi.hypermine.in/explorer): Is basically a view for Hypersign blockchain. It also provides a way to create DIDs(https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/).
* [Hypersign Studio](https://ssi.hypermine.in/studio/): Is a web portal where [verifiable credential](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/) can be issued by the issuer, [verifiable presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/vc-data-model/#presentations) can be generated by holder/subject and it can be verified by the verifier.

## Case Study 

Let's try to understand the flow with a case study - *Flight Ticket Booking System*.

> Vishwas, a frequent traveller of XYZ Airline which works under Ministry of Civil Aviation, requests a flight ticket for Chennai to Patna. Once the ticket is issued, he goes to the airport to presents his ticket (which other credentials like a passport or voter id etc.) to the security personal, David, at the security check. The security personal verifies the ticket and lets him enter into the boarding area.

In this case study we have the following actor:

* XYZ: The airline company - the issuer.
* Vishwas: The passenger - the holder/subject
* David: The security personal - the verifier.

## Get did

As we discussed earlier, on SSI ecosystem, all actors can issue DIDs to themselves. To create a DID go to [Hypersign Identity explorer](https://ssi.hypermine.in/explorer) and click on `Get DID` button on the navbar. 

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/expl-dash.png)

Click on `Register` after filling your name. Remember, this is going to be on the open network hence you only enter details which you want to make public. Let's say for this demo we act as admin of airline company and enter alias as `AirLineAdmin`.

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/expl-didnew.png)

On clicking on `Register` button, user's private-public keys generated (`keys.json` file) and DID gets created on our dummy network. You can download your keys and store it on your computer for later use. Let's take a look at what `keys.json` contains:

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/expl-keys-json.png)

As you can see it contains you `private key`. This is step will not be required from the Identity explorer when we have a mobile wallet -  which is currently under development. 

Once the did is created, you can see your did on the network:

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/expl-did-dash.png)

Click on you did in the table to see your DID document

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/expl-did-resolve.png)

As you can see, the DID doc, contains your DID, public key and other public information including the alias, `AirlineAdmin`

Ideally, all three actors will have their own DIDs. But let's just for the sake for this demo we use one DID and act as issuer, holder and verifier all three.

## Get onboard on studio

Now that we have DID, let us go to [Hypersign Studio](https://ssi.hypermine.in/studio/) to play with verifiable credentials. To issue credentials, let for register and login into this portal. 

### Register

Go to [Hypersign Studio](https://ssi.hypermine.in/studio/) and click on the `signup` button to register. 

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/stdio-login.png)

Fill in your details and click on `SignUp` button. Make sure you fill the did as well which you had generated in the previous step.

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-reg.png)

On clicking on `SignUp` button, you will receive an email and will be asked to click on a link to download `verifiable credential` file. 

## Login

Now you have two files, `keys.json` and `vc_fe4..925.json` (don't worry about the complexities like why we are using files to login and all, it will be clear in the end). Use both of these files to login into the studio app.

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-login.png)

## Dashboard

On the successful login, you will enter into the dashboard, where you can see some of the basic details like, `number of schema created`, `number of credentials issued`, `your profile` and `network details`. See the fig below:

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-dashboard.png)

## Create schema

Now that you are into the app, you can plan to issue flight ticket to a passenger (let's say it is you only). Now to issue a ticket, the ticket must have a `schema`. The `Schema` is nothing but `format` (defined by aviation governing body, say [DGCA](https://dgca.gov.in/digigov-portal/) in India) which can decide what format all airline companies should follow to issue airline tickets in India. The standard format is important for systems to understand each other and work together. 

So let us assume that airline company itself is that aviation body for sake of simplicity. Click on `Schema` button in the nav to go to the schema page. A schema must have a name and required attributes (basically what fields) - fill those details and click on `Create` button. We should also note that when the schema is created, it can be public so that other issuer can use that schema to issue verifiable credentials.

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-schema.png)

## Issue credential

Let's us go ahead and issue a flight ticket using the schema which we created in the previous step. The first thing which is required here is, to whom are you going to issue the ticket/credential? i.e. the passenger of the subject. Let's say you are issuing to yourself.  

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-issue-cred.png)

Fill in the holder DID and select the `Air_ticket_credential_schema` schema. On selecting the schema, you need to fill the defined attributes. Click on the `Create` button after filling the form.

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-issue-cred-1.png)

A ticked in the form of verifiable credential is issued. Click on download to see the credential.

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-issue-cred-2.png)

In this credentials, you can see the following details. 

* **type**: tells what is the type of this verifiable credentials. In our case it is, `Air_ticket_credential_schema` schema.
* **credentialSubject**: tells claims about the subject like passenger name, source, destination, fare etc.
* **proof**: contains the digital signature of the issuer. It also contains publicKey identifier, the type of signature (what is the algorithm used for the signature?) and proof purpose.

Take a look at the fig below: 

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-issue-cred-3-vc.png)

## Generate Presentation

Now that you have issued credential to the subject/holder (in this case you are the subject), you can send it via some means of communication (ideally it would be, DID communication protocol) to the subject. The subject then has to generate something called `verifiable presentation` which is essentially a doc containing the verifiable credentials and the signature of the subject. The subject can also have the ability to share partial information or hide information but share only the proof that he has that information (Zero-knowledge proof). 

Let's create a verifiable presentation with our credential. To create a presentation, click on the `Presentation` tab in the nav. Upload the verifiable credential (the flight ticket) and click on `Generate` button. 

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-vp-gen.png)

Once the presentation is generated, click on `Download Presentation` link to download the presentation and open it some notepad to understand what it contains.

![s](/images/hypersignv1.0/studio-vp.png)

In this VP you can see the following details:

* **type**: type of the document, `VerifiablePresentation`.
* **verifiableCredential**: list of credentials. In our case, it has just one entry -  the ticket which was issued. 
* **proof**: contains the digital signature of the subject. It also contains the publicKey identifier, the type of signature (what is the algorithm used for the signature?) and proof purpose.

Note that a verifiable presentation contains proofs of issuers as well as proof of the subject. Its means that the verifier has to know both these things, who is presenting the credential? and who has issued the presentation to whom?

## Verify Presentation

Now the presentation is generated by the subject or passenger, he can give that to security personal to verify the ticket. Let's us assume, you are also the verifier. So in order to verify the presentation, click on the `Verify Presentation` section in the Presentation page and upload the verifiable presentation. On clicking on `View` button, the verifies and view the details of document like issuer, subject, claims etc. 

Once he satisfies with information, he can click on the `Verify` button to verify the digital signatures. Take a look below:
